# THEREMIX - Virtual Theremin

THEREMIX is a progressive web app that brings the interaction of a physical theremin into the virual space. The virtual theremin can be controlled either with mouse/touch inputs or with gestures through a webcam via human post tracking provided by PoseNet. This app celebrates the 100th anniversary of the theremin, invented by LÃ©on Theremin in 1920. A century after its conception, the theremin continues to be a flexible electronic instrument with an ethereal tone.

THEREMIX's MIDI controller mode uses the same input controls and maps them to modify the attack, sustain, delay, and release of the synths. This mode is still in beta and works most smoothly in Chrome at the moment. Features 14 demo track, with user uploaded MIDI/BG image to be a feature in the next release.
